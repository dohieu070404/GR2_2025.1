# Sample Mosquitto ACL.
#
# This is intentionally permissive for local development.
# For production, create separate MQTT users per home/device/hub and restrict
# their topic patterns accordingly.

user smarthome

# DEV: allow this user to read/write everything under home/...
topic readwrite home/#

# Diagnostics used by backend healthcheck/roundtrip tests
topic readwrite diagnostics/#

# PRODUCTION IDEA (example):
# - backend user: allow home/#
# - per-home user: allow home/<homeId>/#
# - per-device user: allow only home/<homeId>/device/<deviceId>/+
